    Hi! I'm Artan Bayram. I live in Skopje. Currently i am studying at FINKI computer science.
    After graduating at Josip Broz Tito Skopje i had 3 free months for thinking what am i supposed to do for my career and life.
    I started to eliminate slowly all things that i dont want to be and after a long time i realized that computer engineering is the only branch that left.
    I've been through a lot so far;
    Traveling, reading, vacation, conferences, activities etc.
    But coding, building projects things like this were always activities that i find fun and beneficial.</div>

<div id="aboutmeP2">My targets:
    I wanna become developer and especially rising up on web design projects.
    I'm planning to build a projects for making people's work easier as other companies are doing.
    Nowadays it is harder to rise up in this branch than it was before 10 years this is the hardest dot but also most important one,
    cause of this reason we can improve ourselves and raise the bar up every day more and more.
    Computer science and computer engineering is based for giving serve to people, this means random guy can be our customer or user and
    while helping them also we can make nice income.</div>
